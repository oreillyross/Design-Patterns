# Design-Patterns
A working example of most of the GoF design patterns in Java

Strategy Pattern
</hr>

The Design Patterns authors define the Strategy pattern as:

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. [The] Strategy [pattern] lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
The Strategy pattern lets you build software as a loosely coupled collection of interchangeable parts, in contrast to a monolithic, tightly coupled system. That loose coupling makes your software much more extensible, maintainable, and reusable.

Decorator Pattern

Decorators decorate an object by enhancing (or in some cases restricting) its functionality. Those objects are referred to as decorated. Decorators extend the decorated class (or implement the decorated interface), which lets decorators masquerade as the objects they decorate. They also maintain a reference to a Decorated instance. That instance is the object that the decorator decorates.
